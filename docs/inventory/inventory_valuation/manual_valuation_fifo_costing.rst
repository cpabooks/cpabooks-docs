   single: FIFO Costing and Manual Valuation

Compute the inventory valuation and cost of goods sold using fifo costing method
================================================================================

The manual inventory valuation method suggest that the valuation of an
inventory has to be manage manually in financial accounting. The
periodic journal entry has to be passed on regular internal so keep
updated the valuation in balance sheet and cost of goods sold in profit
and loss account.

On every regular internal an accounting entry has to be passed as below:

+---------------------+-----------+------------+
| **Description**     | **Debit** | **Credit** |
+=====================+===========+============+
| Inventory Valuation |           | 800        |
+---------------------+-----------+------------+
| Cost of Goods Sold  | 800       |            |
+---------------------+-----------+------------+

To compute the cost of goods sold use the below formula

``COGS = Inventory Valuation as per Balance sheet - Inventory Valuation
as per Inventory``

Product Cost price
------------------

The cost price on the product page always display the cost of last unit sold
or consumed or scrapped from the stock. If you change that manually it will not
make any changes in the system.

.. tip:: Hide the product cost field, if all of your products have FIFO
  as the inventory costing method, even-users will never get confused.
