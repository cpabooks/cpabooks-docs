Reserve stock for preferred customer, deliver them when they place an order
===========================================================================

Business Case
-------------
Some times in business you need to reserver stock for specific product
when your preferred customer request, so that you can preserver that stock for
preferred customer and should not be assigned to any other customer.

Later when preferred customer place an order you can deliver the products
form that reserver stock only or you can actually choose from which stock
you would like to make the delivery.

.. tip:: You can use the same configuration, when you would like to choose
  the specific stock (lots) irrespective of removal strategy.
