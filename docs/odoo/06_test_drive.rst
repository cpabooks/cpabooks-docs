**Odoo Runbot** is automated test platform user for the continuous integration designed and developed by Odoo SA.

Odoo Employees worldwide use this platform for the internal testing before merging any feature into the master branch.

Background colours of committee represents the status of the committee, Green represents successfully tested without any ERROR while Red represents ERROR in the code, either code is not clean or there is any test-case failed. You can not connect the committee which are in Blue color as there are currently being tested by the runbot.

Most of the features under development can be found under ``odoo-dev/odoo`` or ``odoo-dev/enterprise`` menu, branche name started with master- are the features under development while ``10-xxx-xxx`` or ``11-xxx-xxx`` are the fixes for the respective versions.

Connect to the test instance
----------------------------
You can connect and test every single committee on the development branch, click on the ``Sign in to this build`` icon.

.. tip:: The default username will be admin and password will be admin too for all the instance, if may not able to connect in case some visitor has changed the password.

You can perform the test on two different databases:

* Installed all the applications with demo data
* Installed only base application without demo data - you have to install additional applications you want to test.

.. danger:: **Online Demo** and **Runbot** is not suitable platform to prepare the demo as no guarantee to get the same data all the time, because several users using those instances so data may change without notifications.
