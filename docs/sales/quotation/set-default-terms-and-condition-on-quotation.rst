Set default terms and condition on quotation
============================================
Letâ€™s take an example of the trading company, they want to define the terms and
conditions should be applied on all the quotation created by any salesman.

They want to set the below point as a default terms and conditions:

- This proposal is valid for 30 days
- The goods will be delivered within 10 working days
- All the taxes will be charged extra
- The payment should be released immediately with confirmed order

.. tip:: The payment terms will be added automatically at the end of
  every quotation as a part of the terms and conditions in the printed
  quotation if any.
