Business Case
-------------
Customer will get the price benefit when they buy more quantity. I am purchasing
Belgian beers in bulk and sell in different packages (i.e Pack of 10, 8, 6 and 4)

I would like to do the discount when customer buy the bigger pack and less discount
for small of Belgian beers.
