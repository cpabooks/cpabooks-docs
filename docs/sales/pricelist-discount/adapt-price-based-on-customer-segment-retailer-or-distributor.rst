Business case
-------------

The *My Company* sells the electronic products such as *Computers*,
*Laptops*, and *Printers*, they want to set up the pricing rules for
their *Retailer* and *Distributors*. The price they would like to offer
are as below:

+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+

|                 | (MRP)**         | (Price)**       | (Price)**       |
+=================+=================+=================+=================+
| Laptops         | 1099            | 900             | 999             |

+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+

Configuration
-------------

Assumed that the **Sales Management** application installed, let’s see
what are the other configuration you have to do before you execute the
business case.

Pricelist
~~~~~~~~~

To setup the customer segment specific price you have to enable the
feature called **Multiple Sales Prices per Product** available under the
**Sales / Configuration / Settings**. Keep the default option selected
**Multiple prices per product (e.g. customer segments, currencies)**
under the **Sales Pricelist** option, using that you can define the
customer segment specific pricelist.

Product
~~~~~~~

Let’s create the products you are selling, to create the products go to
**Sales / Catalog / Products**, create a product, enter the **Name**,
set **Image** and **Sales Price**, the customer specific price you can
define under the **Sales** tab.

Create a pricelist if not created before, enter the name of the
pricelist (i.e. Retailer Pricelist) and click on **Create “Retailer
Pricelist”** link, enter the **Price** and **Min. Quantity**, keep the
Min. Quantity to 1 by default if you don’t want to put the constraint on
the minimum order quantity.

You can create a multiple lines for the same pricelist (i.e.
*Distributor Pricelist*) in case you want to offer a special price to
the distributor, when they buy more than 1 quantity. (i.e.
**Distributors** can get the *Laptop* at *790* price, if they order
minimum *5* or more quantities)

The **Start Date** and **End Date** is used to limit the offer for a
specific dates, assume that you want to offer a special price for the
Christmas (i.e. **Start Date** to *20/12/2018* and **End Date** to
*31/12/2018*)

Customer
~~~~~~~~

The customers can be defined as a distributor or retailer by setting the
specific pricelist on them. Pricelist can be set on the customer form
under the **Sales & Purchases** tab.

Create sale order
-----------------

Let’s send a quotation to your customer, create the quotation from
**Sales / Orders / Quotation**, depending on the customer the pricelist
will be set on the quotation and the product price will be appeared
accordingly, when you add pdoructs on the quotation.

|image3|

Create a quotation for *China Export* (Distributor), add *50* quantity
of Laptop, the special price *790/unit* applied as we prepare the
quotation for more than *5* quantity.

.. tip:: Pricelist can be changed on the quotation after selecting a
  customer. The pricelist selected on the quotation have the higher
  priority over the pricelist assigned to the customer.

Now, a salesman can create quotations quickly regardless of the customer
type and price offered to them, of course a correct pricelist have to be
configured when you create customer, it can be reviewed later depending
on the turnover.
