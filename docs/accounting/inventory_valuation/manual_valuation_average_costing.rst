   single: Average Costing & Manual Inventory Valuation

Compute the inventory valuation and cost of goods sold using average costing method
===================================================================================

The manual inventory valuation method suggest that the valuation of an
inventory has to be manage manually in financial accounting. The
periodic journal entry has to be passed on regular internal so keep
updated the valuation in balance sheet and cost of goods sold in profit
and loss account.

On every regular internal an accounting entry has to be passed as below:

+---------------------+-----------+------------+
| **Description**     | **Debit** | **Credit** |
+=====================+===========+============+
| Inventory Valuation |           | 800        |
+---------------------+-----------+------------+
| Cost of Goods Sold  | 800       |            |
+---------------------+-----------+------------+

To compute the cost of goods sold use the below formula

``COGS = Inventory Valuation as per Balance sheet - Inventory Valuation
as per Inventory``

Product Cost price
------------------

As your inventory costing method is average, you are allowed to change
the cost price of the product, assumed that you increase the cost price.

.. tip:: Make sure you change the cost price on the product once your
  valuation is equal for inventory and balance sheet, else you may have a
  wrong cost of goods sold entry.

When you see a COGS is having a negative value it means that your value
of the inventory increased in warehouse this should be reflect in the
balance sheet too.

To increase the value in balance sheet you have to pass below journal
entry

+--------------------------------+-----------+------------+
| **Description**                | **Debit** | **Credit** |
+================================+===========+============+
| Inventory Valuation            | 800       |            |
+--------------------------------+-----------+------------+
| Inventory Valuation Difference |           | 800        |
+--------------------------------+-----------+------------+

Or, when you see a COGS is having a positive value it means that your
value of the inventory decreased in warehouse and this should be reflect
in the balance sheet too.

To decrease the value in balance sheet you have to pass below journal
entry

+--------------------------------+-----------+------------+
| **Description**                | **Debit** | **Credit** |
+================================+===========+============+
| Inventory Valuation            |           | 800        |
+--------------------------------+-----------+------------+
| Inventory Valuation Difference | 800       |            |
+--------------------------------+-----------+------------+
